    steps:

      # 2) Install Flutter so that `flutter` is on PATH

        with:
          channel: stable

      # 3) Always run `flutter pub get` inside the Flutter project directory

      - name: Flutter pub get
        working-directory: everyday_cyber

        with:
          languages: ${{ matrix.language }}

        working-directory: everyday_cyber
        run: flutter build macos --release

      # 7) Finally, run the CodeQL analysis
